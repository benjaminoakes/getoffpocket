## You have valuable data in Pocket

For years, Pocket has been a beloved tool for saving articles, videos, and stories. However, with the recent announcement of its shutdown, users are looking for a more permanent, secure home for their "read it later" lists. It's the perfect time to consider an open-source alternative like Wallabag.

## Open Source is Your Data's Best Friend

{% include content_image_columns.html
  content="When a service like Pocket shuts down, your data can be lost forever. Open-source software is different. Because the code is public, you can host it yourself or choose from various providers. If one provider goes down, you can simply move your data to another. This means your data is never locked into a single service, giving you the ultimate protection against service closures."

## Step-by-Step Guide to Migrating from Pocket to Wallabag

### Step 1: Export Your Pocket Data

First, you'll need to download all of your data from Pocket.

{% include content_image_columns.html
  content="Log in to your Pocket account and go to the export page at
  [getpocket.com/export](https://getpocket.com/export){: .important-link }.
  Click the \"Export CSV file\" link."

{% include content_image_columns.html
  content="Pocket will begin processing your request. This can take some time (up to 7 days, according to their page)."

### Step 2: Convert Your Pocket Export for Wallabag

Your Wallabag server may not directly import Pocket's export format. Luckily, a community-made tool makes conversion simple.

{% assign pocket_to_wallabag_url = 'https://benjaminoakes.github.io/pocket-to-wallabag/' %}
{% assign pocket_to_wallabag_url_with_referral = pocket_to_wallabag_url | append: utm_and_rby %}
{% assign pocket_to_wallabag_referral_link = "Go to the [Pocket to Wallabag Converter](" | append: pocket_to_wallabag_url_with_referral | append: "){: .important-link }." %}
{% include content_image_columns.html
  content=pocket_to_wallabag_referral_link
  src="/assets/images/blog/get-off-pocket/pocket_to_wallabag_converter.png"
  alt="Pocket to Wallabag Converter"

{% include content_image_columns.html
  content="Drag and drop the export file you downloaded from Pocket onto the page. The tool will automatically convert it to a Wallabag-compatible \"Instapaper\" format and download it."

### Step 3: Choose a Hosted Wallabag Provider

{% assign wallabag_url = 'https://getoffpocket.com/open-source/wallabag/' %}
{% assign wallabag_url_with_referral = wallabag_url | append: utm_and_rby %}
{% assign wallabag_referral_link = "There are several hosted Wallabag providers to choose from. You can find a [list of trusted providers on getoffpocket.com](" | append: wallabag_url_with_referral | append: "){: .important-link } . After you sign up for one, log into your new Wallabag account." %}
{% include content_image_columns.html
  content=wallabag_referral_link
  src="/assets/images/blog/get-off-pocket/wallabag_main.png"
  alt="Wallabag Main Interface"
  caption="Wallabag's clean, modern interface"
  content_class="is-half"
  image_class="is-half"
  reverse=true
%}

### Step 4: Import Your Data into Wallabag

Finally, it's time to import your converted file.

{% include content_image_columns.html
  content="In your Wallabag account, open the menu and click Import. On the next screen, select Instapaper as the source."

%}

{% include content_image_columns.html
  content="Click the \"FILE\" button and select the converted file from Step 2, then click \"UPLOAD FILE\". Wallabag will begin importing your articles. This may take some time depending on the size of your library."
  alt="Import in Progress"

  reverse=true

  image_class="is-half"
%}
