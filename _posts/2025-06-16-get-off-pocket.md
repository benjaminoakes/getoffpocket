For years, Pocket has been a beloved tool for saving articles, videos, and stories. However, with the recent announcement of its shutdown, users are looking for a more permanent, secure home for their "read it later" lists. It's the perfect time to consider an open-source alternative like Wallabag.

This guide will walk you through migrating from Pocket to a hosted Wallabag instance, ensuring your data remains safe, accessible, and under your control.

## Why Open Source is Your Data's Best Friend

When a service like Pocket shuts down, your data can be lost forever. Open-source software is different. Because the code is public, you can host it yourself or choose from various providers. If one provider goes down, you can simply move your data to another. This means your data is never locked into a single service, giving you the ultimate protection against service closures.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Migrating from Pocket to Wallabag

### Step 1: Export Your Pocket Data

First, you'll need to download all of your data from Pocket.

Log in to your Pocket account and go to the export page at getpocket.com/export. Click the "Export CSV file" link.

  <figcaption class="has-text-centered is-italic mt-2">The Pocket export page where you can request your data</figcaption>
</figure>

Pocket will begin processing your request. This can take some time (up to 7 days, according to their page).

You will receive an email with a link to download your data. Save the file to your computer.

</figure>

### Step 2: Convert Your Pocket Export for Wallabag

Wallabag doesn't directly import Pocket's export format. Luckily, a community-made tool makes conversion simple.

Go to the [Pocket to Wallabag Converter](https://benjaminoakes.github.io/pocket-to-wallabag/).

</figure>

Drag and drop the export file you downloaded from Pocket onto the page. The tool will automatically convert it to a Wallabag-compatible "Instapaper" format and download it.

### Step 3: Choose a Hosted Wallabag Provider

There are several hosted Wallabag providers to choose from. You can find a list of trusted providers on getoffpocket.com. After you sign up for one, log into your new Wallabag account.

  <figcaption class="has-text-centered is-italic mt-2">Wallabag's clean, modern interface</figcaption>
</figure>

### Step 4: Import Your Data into Wallabag

Finally, it's time to import your converted file.

In your Wallabag account, open the menu and click Import.

On the next screen, select Instapaper as the source.

Click the "FILE" button and select the converted file from Step 2, then click "UPLOAD FILE".

</figure>

Wallabag will begin importing your articles. This may take some time depending on the size of your library.

## Your Data Is Now Safe and Secure

That's it! You've successfully migrated your "read it later" list to a secure, open-source platform. Now, you can enjoy all the features you loved about Pocket, with the added peace of mind that comes from knowing your data is truly yours. With Wallabag, you're not just a user—you're in control.
